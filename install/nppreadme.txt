Welcome to the FHIR Notepad++ install

This program will install the fhir Notepad++ plug-in.

Choosing a Directory
--------------------

This installer guesses that Notepad++ has been installed to it's 
default location (C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++).
If you installed it somewhere else, then you'll have to change
the location accordingly.

Notes:  
* The plug-in and the install are both very alpha
* if Notepad++ is running during the install, you'll 
  need to restart it after the install is complete
